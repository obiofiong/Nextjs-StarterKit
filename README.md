# NEXT JS STARTER PROJECT

#### Next js | Styled Components | Redux Toolkit | Styled-Icons | Redux Persist

## Description

Due to my love for Next js, styled-components and Redux Toolkit and the unneccessary stress that comes with setting up a new Next js project with the aforementioned libraries, I decided to make a starter project to save you a lot of stress in configuring your nextjs projext and these libraries.

A lot of the stress that comes with setting up these packages with Nextjs are as a result of Next js being run on the a development server.
Some of these stress include:

- Styled components (I already created the nextjs custom document file to help in injecting the styles). Server side rendered Styled Components with NextJS.
- Configuring Redux toolkit with next js app can be tiresome.
- Redux persist storage used to persist redux stores to local storage is not as simple to set up when using Next js.
- Also, I integrated styled icon into the project that can be used

This is a Starter Project to get you quickly started with Next js, Styled-components, Redux Toolkit and styled-icons.

You also get global imports from any of your file.
For example

```bash
    import CounterReducer from "store"
```

## Getting Started | Installation

Make a clone of this project by using the command below

```bash
    git clone
```

Then cd into the project directory and install all dependencies.

If you use npm then you should run

```bash
    npm install
```

Otherwise, if you are using yarn then you should run

```bash
    yarn add
```

---

To run the project

```bash
    npm run dev
```

Then go to your browser and open http://localhost:3000 to see the project running.

You can start by editing the _index.js_ file in the pages folder to start your development.
